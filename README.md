# Physio Care System
A complete application to help physical therapists to manage their home visits, profits and schedule.

Hi there. A brief history comes... 
I made this application because I'm a physical therapist who assist patient at their homes and found it was difficult to manage my schedule, profitage and it is really boring to use pencil and paper in this days, AND ALSO I'm doing a career transition. Yes, I want to be a Developer and this system is part of my learning. So I made this app for my personal use, but I think good I could share with my profession colleagues 


This backend system uses runs at NodeJs and MongoDB as DB.

The web version and mobile version are going to be developed in react and react native, respectively. I already have a project that helps me with my schedule and profitage (https://github.com/joaoseixas88/mobilefisio). It is a prototype of this application and uses no backend, its just a simple app that store data on async storage.
